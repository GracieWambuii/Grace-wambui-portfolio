# Digital Forensics Projects

## Forensic Disk Analysis

This repository contains my work on forensic disk analysis using **Autopsy** and **FTK Imager**. The goal of these exercises was to gain hands-on experience in digital forensics investigations, evidence acquisition, and analysis.

### Tools Used
- **Autopsy:** Open-source digital forensics platform used for analyzing disk images, recovering deleted files, and investigating file activity.
- **FTK Imager:** Tool used to create forensic images of drives, preserving data integrity and generating hash values for evidence verification.

### Key Activities
- Acquired disk images from sample drives using FTK Imager.
- Conducted comprehensive disk analysis using Autopsy, including:
  - File system examination
  - Recovering deleted files
  - Analyzing user activity
  - Generating reports on findings
- Documented procedures and findings for learning and portfolio purposes.

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding forensic imaging and evidence preservation.
- Familiarity with disk analysis workflows and investigation procedures.
- Ability to extract and interpret digital evidence for investigative purposes.
